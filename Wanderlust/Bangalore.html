    <p>One of the most popular mega cities in the world, Bengaluru is known as the silicon 
        valley of India. For those who have never traversed the beautiful lanes of Bengaluru, 
        this modern city is just a land of apartments and industries for them. But to their 
        surprise, Bengaluru is actually a hill station that has developed over a period of time
         into a modern settlement. Therefore, it is home to hundreds of natural places, ranging 
         from lakes to hills and forests to waterfalls. Today, it is the only mega city in the country 
         that enjoys a calm, pleasant weather throughout the year.

      <h3 class="places">Bangalore Palace</h3>
      <p>
        An epitome of great architecture and beauty, The Majestic Bangalore Palace preserves in it the spice
         of old regal opulence. Currently the central attraction in Bangalore, the palace was built in the year 
         1878. Chamarajendra Wadiyar's British Guardians bought the original property in 1873 from the principal 
         of Bangalore Central High School, Rev, J Garret, from his funds. The palace is extraordinarily vast and 
         spread across 45,000 square feet. A mixture of Tudor and Scottish Gothic architecture have resulted into 
         the grand palace that we see today.The wooden structure of the palace along with the beautiful carvings 
         both inside and outside showcases the royal culture in different ways.
         Apart from being a major tourist destination, the palace is a host to different cultural events, rock 
         shows, and marriages. As per beliefs, King Chamarajendra Wadiyar drew his inspiration for building the 
         palace from the Windsor Castle of London. The granite seats decorated with fluorescent blue ceramic tiles 
         on the ground floor, a fairy tale Ballroom, the famous painter Raja Ravi Varma's paintings, vine-covered 
         walls, and the Durbar Hall on the first floor come together to form the prepossessing Bangalore Palace. 
         A visit to the palace gives you a chance to witness the elegant and lavish splendour of one of the most 
         powerful dynasties of South India. An audio tape is available inside the Palace, both in Hindi and 
        English, to help the people having language issues, understand its history better.

         on weekends.

      <h3 class="places">TippuSultanPalace</h3>
      <p>
        Located at the juncture of Albert Victor Road and Krishna Rajendra, is the magnificent accommodation 
        of the valiant ruler of Mysore- Tipu Sultan. The palace is located in the Bangalore Fort which is situated 
        in old Bangalore in the south-west Indian state of Karnataka. An exquisite example of Indo- Islamic 
        architecture, the opulent palace was once used as a summer retreat by the king and was often referred to 
        as the 'Abode of Happiness' and 'Rash e Jannat' meaning 'Envy of Heaven'. Amongst one of the most noteworthy
         creations of the ancient times, the palace boasts of ornamental frescoes, magnificent arches, protruding 
         balconies and brilliant motifs. One can take a good leisurely stroll across the balconies before entering 
         the palace. One is bound to get a glimpse into the royal lifestyle of Tipu Sultan as they explore the palace.

        The construction of the fort started during the reign of Hyder Ali and was completed in 1791, during the rule 
        of Tipu Sultan. Among the several unique aspects of the two-storeyed palace are its huge wooden pillars, 
        glorifying brackets and its all- around idyllic and placid setting. After the death of Tipu Sultan, the British 
        used the monument for its Secretariat until about 1868, before moving to Attara Kacheri. Blessed with lush green 
        gardens, flowering shrubs and sparkling fountains, the palace is an attractive tourist site and a slice of solitude 
        in the heart of the city. Lately, a small part of the fort has also been converted into a museum showcasing various
         events of the life and times of Tipu Sultan. Once tourists enter the fort, they are bound to feel like they 
         have entered a different place and a different era altogether. The palace has a serene vibe that will make one 
         feel at peace the moment they walk
