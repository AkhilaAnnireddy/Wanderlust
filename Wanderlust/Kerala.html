    <h3 class="places">Places to visit</h3>
    <p>Famously known as 'God's Own Country', Kerala is a state located on the Malabar coast of Southern India. 
        Home to a vast network of brackish lagoons called backwaters, ayurvedic massages, wildlife sanctuaries, 
        sprawling tea gardens, hill-stations, palm tree-lined beaches and colourful dance forms, Kerala has 
        everything on offer to take your pick from!
    </p>
    <h3 class="places">Munnar</h3>

        Famous for its tea estates, various shades of green, blankets of mist and craggy peaks, Munnar is aptly 
        known as the 'Kashmir of South India'.

        Munnar serves as the commercial centre for some of the world's largest tea estates. Besides, Munnar has 
        many protected areas which are home to endemic and highly endangered species like the Nilgiri Thar and the 
        Neelakurinji.

        natural view-points apart from the tea-plantations. Munnar is divided into Old Munnar, where the tourist 
        information office is, and Munnar, where the bus station and most guest houses are located. The Eravikulam 
        National Park, Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary and tea plantations are its major attractions.

      <h3 class="places">Allepey</h3>

        Officially called Alappuzha, Alleppey is a city in the South Indian state of Kerala. Bordering the Laccadive Sea,

        Ayurvedic resorts.

        Allepey is also popular for its Houseboat cruises that pass through the serene backwaters, where you can catch 
        glimpses of green paddy fields, choir making activities, beautiful avifauna and witness the life of locals in 
        Kerala. Towards the shore lies the Alleppey beach in the Arabian Sea, a beautiful example of the gems youâ€™d find 
        along the Malabar Coast. The appeal of this beach is only amplified by the history attached to it, and a walk down
        the 137-year old pier is a must. Be sure to catch a traditional snake boat race in the months of August and 
        September and try out some toddy (palm wine) at a local toddy shop for adding a touch of authenticity to your 
        travel experience in Allepey.
